# KmehrFhirTransitionVersioning
Transversal GitHub for the following projects 
- HubsOnFHIR (how will the HUB/METAHUB system embrace FHIR)
- KmehrToFHIR (how will we manage the migration of information from KMEHR repositories to FHIR repositories)
- FHIRStandardVersioningStrategy  (how will we handle the new versions of the International FHIR standard on a Belgian level)
- BelgianProfileVersioningStrategy (how will we handle the coexistence of profiles of different versions in Belgian FHIR repositories)

Questions and clarifications that are common to the four projects will be handled here.
